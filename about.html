I am Yue Gu, a recently graduated Ph.D. at MD Anderson Cancer Center and the University of Texas School of Public Health from Texas Medical Center. Over the past several years,
I worked at MD Anderson Cancer Center to study the genomic mechanism of Cancer. Under the mentorship of Drs. John Paul Shen, Luis Leon-Novelo, and Traver Hart,
I designed and developed a simulation framework to model genetic interactions in CRISPR screening, which formed the core basis of my dissertation research.

I'm Lexi Jones-Kellett, a Postdoctoral Associate in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) Department at MIT,
working in the <a href="https://darwinproject.mit.edu/">Darwin Project Group</a> led by Dr. Mick Follows. My research lies in the
discipline of computational oceanography, focusing on the role of mesoscale (10s-100s km) circulations in shaping plankton community 
composition and biogeography. I ultimately seek to understand how biological-physical interactions in the ocean aggregate to support 
the global carbon cycle and the food web. Through this work, I use a combination of satellite remote sensing observations, 
in situ observations (e.g. amplicon sequencing, flow cytometry, autonomous vehicles), and numerical simulations. My favorite tool is 
Lagrangian trajectory analysis, which is a method of tracking the transport of water parcels through space and time. More details on my 
specific projects can be found on the <a href="https://lexi-jones.github.io/research/">Research page</a>.

<h3>Background</h3>
I hold a Ph.D. in Biostatistics and Data Science with minor in Health Economics and Breadth in Bininformatics from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (2025), 
a M.S. in Biostatistics from Columbia University in the city of New York (2020), and a B.S. double major in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Iowa (2017). My research 
career starts from the University of Iowa as a research intern, where I worked on the parametric testing and statistical modeling on range of movements from burnt patients
in the Department of Surgery. This experience ignited my passion for applying statistical methods to solve real-world biomedical problems. During my study at Columbia University,
following the lead of Drs. Hanga Galfalvy and Melanie Wall, I developed reproducible clustering analysis emphasizing on patients in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Bipolar, and Remitted Depressed Study Group.
These early projects laid a solid foundation for my subsequent academic research and inspired me to pursue a Ph.D. in seeking answers on how we may leverage statistical rigors to complex biomedical questions.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
My research lies in the intersection of biomedical sciences and public health. In my doctoral studies, I span multi-disciplinary research in 
computational biology and statistical methodology development, centered on modeling the dynamics of complex biological systems and applying
novel mathematical models to advance the combinatorial Cancer treatments. My interested areas are:
<ul>
  <li>Cancer Genomics; Somatic Mutation Calling; Genome Analysis; Molecular Oncology Profiling</li>
  <li>Monte-Carlo Methods; Simulation; Statistical Modelling; Reproducible Analysis</li>
  <li>Computational and Mathematical Biology; Genetic Interactions; CRISPR Simulation Design</li>
</ul>
